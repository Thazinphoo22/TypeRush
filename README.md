Hi everyone!

I’m excited to explain how the game TypeRush works. This game is designed to improve your typing speed and accuracy. It features three different modes: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Let’s go through each mode:

1. **Easy Mode**:
   - You will be given easy and short words to type.
   - You need to type as many words as you can within **20 seconds**.

2. **Medium Mode**:
   - The words are moderately difficult.
   - Words must be typed within **15 seconds**.

3. **Hard Mode**:
   - The words are more difficult and longer.
   - You have **10 seconds** to type the given words.

During the game, your performance is measured by two factors: **score** and **mistakes**.
- Your **score** increases with each correctly typed word.
- Any typing errors are recorded as **mistakes**, however it does not affect player's rank in leaderboard as I prefer the minimum score to be zero.

If you come across a word you don’t want to type, you can click the **Next** button to skip it. Skipping a word does not affect your score or mistake count.

When the time is up, you’ll be prompted to enter your name for the leaderboard. The leaderboard ranks players by their scores in descending order, **with the highest score at the top**.

After the game is over, you can choose any mode to play again and try to improve your score.

This game is a fun way to practice typing and challenge your friends. Let’s see who can get to the top of the leaderboard!

**Thank you, and I hope you enjoy playing TypeRush!**
